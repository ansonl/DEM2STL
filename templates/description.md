# REGION_NAME (REGION_ABBR) Topographic Relief Map with Water Features

REGION_NAME mountains, coastlines, streams, and lakes in a dual color topographic and hydrographic map! All topographic states in this [USA of Plastic](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl_365531/collections/714909) project interlock without gaps.

Show off streams, lakes, and coastlines with filament that is glow-in-the-dark, translucent, or simply a different color from the base.

# Which model file should you print? See üåü or ‚≠ê below:

The individual 3D printable 3MF files are cut for your convenience and fit together once printed. The files are in 3MF format instead of STL for smaller file size and in order to store separate land and water objects that are aligned for accurate dual color prints. 3MF is supported in Cura, PrusaSlicer, and other 3D slicers.

## Recommended Files

- REGION_ABBR-sqrt-dual.3mf üåü (Dual extrusion only)
- REGION_ABBR-sqrt-single.3mf ‚≠ê (Single/Dual extrusion OK)

## Model Filename Decoder

`STATE-SCALING-VARIANT-STYLE-VERSION-PIECE##.3mf`

| Definition | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| `STATE` | State Abbreviation |
| `SCALING` | Linear or Square Root (sqrt) elevation scaling. |
| `VARIANT` | Dual or Single color model |
| `STYLE` *(optional)* | `STYLE` is only present when the model is a special style. Default style is low lying land normally covered by water is printed underneath the water. This submerged land may be visible when water is printed with a transparent filament. This option minimizes usage of filament for printing water. `transparent` style means water features go all the way through the land for max light transmission with glow and transparent filaments. |
| `VERSION` | Version number |
| `PIECE##` *(optional)* | Interlocking piece # for 180 mm x 180 mm bed |

| File | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| REGION_ABBR-dual.3mf ‚≠ê                 | Dual color model with land and water features. Low lying land normally covered by water is printed underneath the water. Submerged land may be visible when water object uses transparent filament. This option minimizes usage of filament for the water object. |
| REGION_ABBR-dual-thru.3mf üåü     | Dual color model with land and water features. Water features go all the way through the land for max light transmission with glow and transparent filaments. |
| *REGION_ABBR-dual-p**N**.3mf (optional) | Multi-part dual color models. Interlocking piece number **N** for multi-part print on printers with at least *180 mm x 180 mm* build area. |
| *REGION_ABBR-dual-thru-p**N**.3mf (optional) | Multi-part dual color models. Interlocking piece number **N** for multi-part print on printers with at least *180 mm x 180 mm* build area. |
| REGION_ABBR-single.3mf                  | Single color model with land features and waterways as lines made for single extrusion printers. |
| *REGION_ABBR-single-p**N**.3mf                  | Multi-part single color model Interlocking piece number **N** for multi-part print on printers with at least *180 mm x 180 mm* build area. |

# Recommended print settings

Print the models as is with a dual extrusion printer. If you have a single extrusion printer, you can either print the `*-single.3mf` model or run two single extrusion prints utilizing the Z-hop method on the hydrography model.

You can scale the model up or down as needed to fit your printer size, the final map's scale will just be scaled accordingly. *E.g. 200% scale on a previous scale of **0.4mm:1000m** results in **0.4mm:500m***

Download the optimized Cura print settings profile for topo maps [here](https://www.printables.com/model/529276-contiguous-usa-lower-48-topographic-map-with-hydro). 

***Cura** may automatically scale the model by 10000% so you need to Select All Models `(Ctrl+A)` and manually set the Scale to `100%` and X/Y/Z position to `0,0,0` for the models to show correctly. Merge `(Ctrl+Alt+G)` objects in Cura if you rotate them.*

Printing this will test your 3D printer's XY precision, Z-axis stability, retraction, cooling, and oozing!

| Projection | USA Contiguous Lambert Conformal Conic |
| Horizonal Scale | 1:2500000 (0.4mm:1000m) | Effective resolution is 1000m x 1000m. Territorial waters are included in the dual print models. |
| Vertical Scale | 1:500000 (0.1mm:50m) | Effective vertical exaggeration is 5x. Elevations 0-40m are scaled between 0 and 0.8mm on a logarithmic scale for enhanced coastal detail. |
| Maritime Boundary | Submerged Lands Act | Seaward boundary of coastal states generally 3 or 9 nm from the coastline. |
