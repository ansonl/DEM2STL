# REGION_NAME (REGION_ABBR) Topographic Relief Map with Rivers and Coastal Waters

REGION_NAME mountains, coastlines, streams, and lakes in a dual or single color topographic and hydrographic map! All topographic states in the [USA of Plastic](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/collections/714909) collection are at 1:2500000 scale and interlock with each other similar to a puzzle.

| Definition | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| `STATE` | State Abbreviation |
| `ESCALING` | Linear or Square Root (sqrt) elevation scaling. |
| `EXTRUDER` | Dual or Single color (extrusion) model |
| `STYLE`* *(optional)* | Model special style or subregion. `STYLE` is only present when the model file is a special style or the model is exclusive to a special subregion. |
| `REVISION` | Revision number. See [release notes](https://ansonliu.com/maps/release-notes/) for the latest improvements. |
| `PIECE##`‚Ä† *(optional)* | Interlocking pre-cut piece ## sized for 180 mm x 180 mm bed. |

**Default `STYLE` is water features model located over submerged low lying lands. This submerged land may be visible when water layers are printed with a transparent filament. Default style minimizes usage of secondary (water) filament color. `transparent` style has water model features that extend all the way through the land for maximum light transmission when used with glow and transparent filaments.*

‚Ä†*If multi-part files are not present, I have not created interlocking models for this state yet. Follow me and comment with your request to get future additions and updates.*
