# USA Lower 48 (Contiguous) States Topographic Relief Map with Rivers and Coastal Waters

USA Lower 48 (Contiguous) States color map with borders!

This is the linear scale version of the lower 48 state map. You may be interested in my logarithmic scale version that enhances detail at lower elevations and minimizes bumpiness at high elevations.

The map has is at 1:20000000 horizontal scale and made to fit within the 256x256 buildplate. Vertical exagerration is 40x.

The model has high detail down to 2km so you can scale it up larger and print it in multiple pieces!
